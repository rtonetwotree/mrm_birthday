        <h1>Happy Birthday, Mary Rose!</h1>
        <p>Mary,</p>
        <p>         If you're reading this message it means that you have received the first half of your birthday present. I hope you like it! Unfortunately, the other half of your present has been stolen by a shady group of solemn men in drab clothing who hate fun!! Oh no!! To recover the stolen birthday present, you're going to have to dress cool and have fun! Oh, and you're also going to have to travel around the city to various Beatles-related landmarks and gather some information. I hope you're up for a challenge!</p>
        
        <p>Good Luck! To start your adventure, click <a href="https://rtonetwotree.github.io/mrm_birthday_surprise_project/">here</a>.</p>
