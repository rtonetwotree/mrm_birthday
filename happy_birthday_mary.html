        <p>Mary,</p>
        <p>     Susan Alexandra here. If you're reading this message it means that you have received the first half of your present. I hope you like it! Unfortunately the other half of your present has been stolen by a shady group of solemn men in drab clothing who hate fun!! Oh no!! To recover the stolen birthday present, you're going to have to dress cool and have fun! Oh and also you're going to have to travel around the city to various Beatles-related landmarks (9 total) and gather some information for me. The birthday present will not be unlocked until all of my necessary intel is gathered. </p>
        
        <p>Good Luck! To start your adventure, click <a href="https://rtonetwotree.github.io/mrm_birthday_surprise_project/">here</a>.</p>
